# Apple-Stock-Prices
Leveraged Using data from Yahoo Finance, we used various machine learning regression models and time-series models such  as LSTM, SARIMA, and Facebook's Prophet to predict Apple stock prices, and as a result, I came to the conclusion that  investors can invest in Apple's stock market due to its high closing price. I used data visualization libraries like seaborn,  matplotlib to visualize trends in open, high and closing prices. I also tested how stock data works on tree-based algorithms such  as decision trees and random forests. To get the optimal parameters, I also employed hyper-parameter tweaking techniques like  Grid search CV. To understand how boosting algorithms like LG boost and XG boost work on time series data, I used them.  We found that LSTM is the best model for this type of problem based on assessment metrics such as RMSE, MSE, and MAE,  as well as the best trained, fitting, and forecasts
